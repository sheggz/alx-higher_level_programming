# **Concept in view: Python - Exceptions**
___

## Description
Errors encompass any irregularity that lead to a code not executing at all or\ executing wrongly. Exceptions are Errors detected during execution of a syntatically correct code.\ exceptions can be handled with "try, except, else and finally statements"
> try: here, we write the code to be executed given the expected inputs
> expect: here we write our response to an anticipated error given the wrong input
> else: here, we write some code that executes if no error occurs
finally: here, we write some code that executes whether an error occurs or not
