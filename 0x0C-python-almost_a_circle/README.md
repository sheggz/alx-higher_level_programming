_models/rectangle.py_: wrtie the class Rectangle that inherits from Base 
_models/rectangle.py_: Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded)
_models/rectangle.py_: Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.
_models/rectangle.py_: Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here.
_models/rectangle.py_: Update the class Rectangle by overriding the __str__ method so that it returns [Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>
_models/rectangle.py_: Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y
