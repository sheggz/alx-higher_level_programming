Concept in view: Control Flow tools in python - if/else, loops, functions

This directory houses various tasks that puts into application the above concepts

0-positive_or_negative.py - to  Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

1-last_digit.py - to Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

2-print_alphabet.py - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

3-print_alphabt.py - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

4-print_hexa.py -  a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)

5-print_comb2.py - a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 (with some conditions)

6-print_comb3.py - a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

7-islower.py -  a function that checks for lowercase character

8-uppercase.py - a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

9-print_last_digit.py - a function that prints the last digit of a number.

10-add.py - a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

11-pow.py - a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

12-fizzbuzz.py - a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

13-insert_number.c - a function that inserts in a sorted linked list

100-print_tebahpla.py - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.

101-remove_char_at.py - a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
